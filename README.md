# Project Title: Online Reservation Management System with User Authentication

Description: This project is a computer program that allows users to manage reservations for events or services. It includes a secure user authentication system to ensure authorized access. Users can create reservations, view existing ones, and cancel reservations as needed. The system keeps track of reservation details such as names, dates, and the number of guests. It's a useful tool for businesses or organizations that need to handle reservations while maintaining user privacy and security.

#Explanation of the code 


=> let's break down the code into simple terms and explain why each part is used:

1- User Class: This part is used to represent users who will be accessing the reservation system. We need this to check if the person trying to use the system is authorized to do so. It uses a user ID and password to uniquely identify users.


2- Reservation Class: This is used to store information about each reservation. For example, who made the reservation, when it's for, and how many guests are expected. We need this to keep track of all the reservations.


3- ReservationSystem Class: This is where we manage the reservations. It helps us create new reservations, see a list of all reservations, find a reservation by its unique ID, and cancel reservations. We use this to keep everything organized.

4- ReservationSystemUI Class: This is the user interface of our program. It's like the menu you see on a restaurant's website when you want to book a table. It asks users for their user ID and password to ensure they are allowed to use the system. After they log in, they can:

* Make a new reservation by providing their name, the date they want, and how many guests are coming.
* View a list of all existing reservations.
* ancel a reservation if they change their plans.
* Exit the program when they're done.


5- Main Method: This is where the program starts running. It creates an instance of ReservationSystemUI and calls its start method. This is like turning on a computer program. It ensures that users first log in before they can do anything with reservations.


In summary, this code is a simple reservation system with a user login system. We use different parts of the code to represent users, reservations, and the system itself. This helps us keep track of who's making reservations and when. The main method starts the program, and the user interface guides users through the process.
